<p>Use this command to open a drawing file. The file is loaded and shown in
a new window within the QCAD application window. You can switch between
different loaded drawings using the menu "Windows" or the tabs at the top of
the drawing area.</p>

<h3>PDF Files</h3>

<p>
If you open a PDF file, QCAD show a dialog. In this dialog, you can specify 
the page to import, if you want to import images and if clipping should be applied. 
Imported images are stored in a new folder called "pdf_images" located where the 
PDF file is located.
Without clipping, all vector data is imported from the PDF file. This might include 
data outside the paper.
</p>

<h3>CXF Font Files</h3>

<p>
QCAD can also open CXF font files. When opening such a file, each glyph is loaded 
into a separate block. You can then edit the glyph or add new glyphs.
Block names are in the format "[Hexadecimal Unicode] [Character]", 
for example "0x0041 A" for a capital "A" with Unicode 65 (41 in hexadecimal).
