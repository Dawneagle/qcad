Changed in InfoCentroids version 0.31:
======================================

- Circles from hatch boundary bug fix. (version 0.11)
- Checks for QCAD framework >= 3.26.4.5 and adapts. (version 0.13)
    Ifso, excluding all (autoClosed) self-intersection shapes.
    Reports first intersection that is found.
- Excludes polyline with widths and circles and thus its own markers.
- Changed proportional character of markers.
- Centralized critical error handling.

- Labels number formating, decimal point and precision by drawing preferences. (Bug fix)
    List separator by common sense.
- Command History decimal point, list separator and precision by QCAD general preferences.
    Position is in full floating point notation with 17 significant digits.
    What is re-usable as an 'exact' Cartesian position string.
- Added marker custom properties full 17 significant digits values.
    Later to be summed weighted with their individual custom densities.
    Refer to the InfoSumCentroidsWeighted Addon.

- All closed format equations for ellipses and ellipse arcs area & area centroids.
- Improved integration for ellipses:
    For arc wire centroid: At least 4096 arc segments/full ellipse.
    As or as part of a hatch boundary: At least 1024 arc segments/full ellipse.
- Nearly exact full ellipse circumference by two distinct fast converging infinite series expansions.
    For more details see notes inside the function declarations: getFullEllipseWireCentroid,
    getFullEllipseCircumISC and getFullEllipseCircumISGK.
- Improved location stability, shapes are mostly handled as if they were encircling the origin.
- Implemented 'A generalized Kahan–Babuška-Summation-Algorithm' proposed by Klein.
    Running sums can have a poor accuracy due to loss of significance.
    See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahan_summation_algorithm

- Included uniform density area centroid in sector mode for (ellipse) arcs by a hidden switch.
    See QCAD.ini/conf after one initial use.
- Included separate class for uniform density wire methods.
    The wire method handles single and multi selections of any line-art.
    In normal use one would not mix the results of those above.
    Still, all three types of centroids can be summed weighted.

- Misc .. Information menu as adopted by Andrew.
    Keeping in mind that QCAD supports user toolbars.
- Reverted to shortcuts:
    'AM' aka Area center of Mass
    'WM' aka Wire(s) center of Mass
    'CM' aka Combine centers of Mass

- For the scripters: All methods reverted to RShapes
